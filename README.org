gooi, by BRUD

Use gooi for Typographic Clusterflux™.

gooi applies random Google Fonts typefaces on a per-character, word, clause, sentence, or paragraph basis.

For optimal results (and not to hammer the Google Fonts API, use gooi sparingly). 

gooi is a part of c.r.u.d by BRUD ™, a framework for dissonant architecture.
